Welcome
^^^^^^^^

This is my NGS analysis toolkit: ``ngs_toolkit``.

This contains most code I've been using in the last ~2-3 years in various projects and hopefully is of interest to someone.

Head to the :doc:`Introduction <intro>` to see how to install and use the toolkit, or have a look at the catalogue of available functions in the :doc:`API <api>`.
