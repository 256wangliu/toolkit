## toolkit

This is my NGS analysis toolkit: ``ngs_toolkit``.

It contains most code I've been using in the last ~2-3 years in various projects and hopefully is of interest to someone.

Head to the [documentation](http://ngs-toolkit.readthedocs.io/) to see how to install and use the toolkit, and have a look at the catalogue of available functions.

Install with:

```
git clone git@github.com:afrendeiro/toolkit.git
cd toolkit
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```
